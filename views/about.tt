<h1>About this site</h1>

<div>
  <p>
    This site was created to promote the Multi-Core Engine for Perl by Mario Roy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The editors believe that Perl is an excellent choice for parallel-process computing, but that long-ago past limitations have created a false impression among some developers that it is not well-suited to the task. The MCE libraries provide an easy and standard concurrency implementation, whether the compiling Perl is built with or without threads or running on Windows or a Unix-like OS, and including shared variables of all kinds.

    The website is proudly built in <a class="offsite" href="http://perl.org">Perl</a> with <a class="offsite cpan" href="https://metacpan.org/Template">Template::Toolkit</a> on <a class="offsite cpan" href="https://metacpan.org/Dancer2">Dancer2</a>. Code syntax highlighting is done with <a class="offsite cpan" href="https://metacpan.org/PPI-Prettify">PPI::Prettify</a> by David Farrell and <code>sunburst.css</code>, originally by the Google.
